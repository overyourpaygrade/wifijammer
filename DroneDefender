This can incapacitate some ariel drones with applying a Yagi to the Alpha. The drones utilize an
emergency GPS guided take off and landing proceedure when the ISM or wifi signal is lost, or jammed. 
Simply pointing a Yagi at a drone using 2.4 GHz will cause it to land and break the line of site to the 
drone's operator. 
A system for portability is achieved using a 32 "D" cell Battery pack, a resberry pi, a Yagi high gain directional antenae,
50 mm of LMR-400 w/ rp-sma on the alpha side and a TNC - or whatever you have on your Yagi.
The FCC has the following rules regarding these devices
Maximum transmitter output power, fed into the antenna, is 30 dBm (1 watt)
Maximum Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) is 36 dBm (4 watt).
however there is also another less known about exception to the above limits which will allow operation of this device
and be within both the FCC regulations and still take out a drone. EIRP is determined by adding the output from the transmitter 
to the gain from antenae.
Problems:
the output power of the alpha is a maximum of 1 watt which is internally controlled. According to the company the output power
does not come close to 1 watt. It also states this can e tweaked by using external utilities. Since our operation is simplex and
I suspect the Alpha uses the latency from a normal connection to determine the output, a means of controlling the output power
would be helpful.

Also a power meter would be helpful

the newest drones use 5.8 GHz which is covered in 802.11a. 
Antenaes that work are vertical yagi - uda and triple phased yagi. Bringing down cell phone controlled drone instanly from
approx 100 yards using a lab system of the software running on a laptop.
